### Creating a basic React application


Create a directory, where you want your react application to be.. let's say it  REACT_PROJECT


### Hooks

use Effect mount
list context


1. ### Using useState Hooks

    - Importing it in my componenet `Header.js`.

    - Use it like this, inside a function
        ```
            const {name,setName} = useState("header");
            {name}
        ```
        This way,I can use the useState.
